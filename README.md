# 🛡️ Custom SIEM-Based SOC for Lab Monitoring

This project showcases a self-built Security Operations Center (SOC) using a custom Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to monitor personal lab devices. It includes real-time log ingestion, alert generation, and integration with threat intelligence feeds for enhanced detection and response.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- Designed and deployed a **custom SIEM** for centralized monitoring of lab devices
- Ingested logs from multiple sources (endpoints, routers, etc.)
- Created **custom alerting rules** to detect suspicious behavior
- Integrated **threat intelligence feeds** to enrich data and improve response accuracy
- Demonstrated core SOC operations: log analysis, alert triage, and threat hunting

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Custom-built SIEM (e.g., ELK Stack, Graylog, Wazuh, or similar)
- Syslog/Winlogbeat/OSQuery (log shippers)
- Threat Intelligence Feeds (AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, etc.)
- Linux/Windows lab devices
- Custom detection rules & alerting scripts
